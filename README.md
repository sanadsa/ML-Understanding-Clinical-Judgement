## ML-Understanding-Clinical-Judgement

**Description:** This project is designed to simulate a decision-making process for doctors using a tree-based algorithm.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder in the command line or terminal:

   ```
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org).

4. Run the Python script `doctors_tree_decision.py` using the following command:

   ```
   python doctors_tree_decision.py
   ```

   This will execute the decision-making process and provide the output based on the implemented algorithm.

   The output will include two heatmaps: one for the judges and one for the tree decisions. These heatmaps visualize the decision-making process and provide a graphical representation of the results.

### Requirements

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Git (version X.X.X) (optional, if you want to clone the project repository)

### Usage

- Upon running the script, follow the prompts and provide the necessary inputs to proceed with the decision-making process.
